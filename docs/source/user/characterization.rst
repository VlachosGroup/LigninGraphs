Characterization
===================


For a polymer molecule, the structure metrics include:

    * Number (or percentage) of monomers
    * Number (or percentage) of linkages
    * Number of methoxy groups (-OCH3)
    * Number of Phenolic hydroxy groups (-OH)
    * Molecular weight
    * Size (total number of monomers)
    * Branching coefficient


For a population of structures, the global metrics include:

    * Average percentage (or distributions) of monomers
    * Average percentage (or distributions) of linkages
    * Average (or distributions of) molecular weight
    * Average (or distributions of) size
    * Global branching coefficient
